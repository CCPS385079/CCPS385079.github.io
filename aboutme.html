  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>1. I am working towards getting better grades in school, behaving and a lot more towards me going to college, I am also working on baseball so that way I can make varsity next year, I am currently getting better at hitting and fielding because i play middle infield and I am not that good at hitting.
2.  I am working towards these goals by studying before tests and making sure i get all of my homework done before the end of the day, i make sure to study the subject i am not the brightest at but make sure to do all the subjects. I am also going almost every weekend to the batting cages and i also make sure to go to all the practices i can go to, to get better.
3. The values i consider for my success are my teacher, counselors ext. because i feel that they help me get the things i need to pass and when the time comes to help me look for a good college to go to.
4. Some short term goals i feel help me to be me is to make sure I am clean, because i hate when my room is messy so i make sure to clean it up once a week.
5. Character traits I want to most known for is being a student athlete, I want to be excelling in school and also be able to play baseball at the same time.</p>
